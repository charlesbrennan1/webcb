      <!-- Project Overview -->
      <div class="project-content reveal" style="max-width: 900px;">
        <h2 class="h2" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">Q1 Business Metrics Foundation</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: var(--space-xl);">
          One of the projects I took ownership of was building out a comprehensive KPI framework for our warehouse operations. Early on, I pulled together a full set of Q1 metrics that gave leadership a clearer picture of customer and operational performance. This included calculating customer retention and conversion rates, average order value, refund and return rates, and inventory efficiency metrics such as turnover, days in inventory, and bounce rate. Pulling those numbers together not only highlighted where the business was performing well but also surfaced areas of concern, like low turnover and high refund rates, that carried direct financial implications.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">NetSuite Dashboard Development</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: var(--space-xl);">
          From there, I proposed creating a new warehouse KPI dashboard in NetSuite. While the company already had a reporting system, it lacked the level of visibility needed to manage daily productivity and labor efficiency. I designed a dashboard that tied directly into the Q1 insights and built out more actionable warehouse-level metrics. These included picking and packing productivity (# of orders per hour, broken down by individual and team), cycle times for fulfillment, daily productivity starting at a consistent baseline, and rankings of the top four pickers and packers by SKU. I also included order backlog tracking so managers could allocate labor in real time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">Business Intelligence Integration</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: var(--space-xl);">
          The significance of this work was that it connected high-level business KPIs with warehouse execution data. Instead of only seeing outcomes like customer retention or return rates after the fact, leadership could now trace those results back to how efficiently the warehouse was operating day to day. The dashboard allowed us to monitor productivity in real time, reduce fulfillment delays, and identify training or process changes more quickly.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">Strategic Impact & Initiative</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.6;">
          For me, this was another example of taking initiative to build tools that gave the organization better visibility and decision-making power—moving from static reporting to a live operational intelligence framework.

      <h1 class="h1" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: var(--space-3xl);">About Me</h1>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">I started my career shortly after graduating from Rutgers, bringing with me a Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt mindset that shaped how I approached every challenge. My first real test came at TLF, where I moved from the classroom into the warehouse. It was not glamorous work at the start, picking sales orders with handheld devices and processing shipments through NetSuite and ShipStation, but it gave me a ground level view of how supply chains actually operate. That perspective stayed with me and became the foundation of how I think about systems and efficiency.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">At TLF, I pushed myself to look beyond the day-to-day and began building my own projects. I created dashboards to track warehouse KPIs, broke down order and inventory flows, and led a global shipping analysis that identified hidden costs in dimensional weight billing. That analysis alone saved the company tens of thousands of dollars each year and showed me the power of combining data with process improvement. It was here that I realized I had a knack for seeing patterns others overlooked and turning them into actionable change.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-l);">That drive carried me into Nucleus Research, where I've grown into a Senior Analyst focused on enterprise software. I now spend my time interviewing customers, leading research studies, and building Value Matrices that guide organizations in supply chain planning, ERP, and manufacturing execution decisions. The work has taken me from detailed ROI case studies to global survey-driven reports, and it lets me combine the data rigor I developed at Rutgers and TLF with the storytelling needed to influence executives and vendors alike.</p>
      
      <p>Looking ahead, I am interested in roles that build on this blend of hands-on operations, analytical depth, and strategic insight. I see myself thriving in product management, corporate strategy, market intelligence, or product marketing within enterprise technology, as well as opportunities in consulting or corporate development where my ability to connect data and business outcomes can drive measurable impact.</p>
